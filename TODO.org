Release Planning 
======================================================================================

- de-priortize FP support, this will only be for advanced users (until newer versions)

Small:
- [ ] fluidbox string, i.e. wind-around the entity giving fluidbox location and type
  - [ ] include in debug output
- [ ] validation of recipes:
  - might not be so important with Helmod
  - [ ] the normal flow should follow a topological order, failure indicates something is wrong
- [ ] item buffer limits not configured

Medium:
- [ ] Loops
  - [ ] when creating lane ports, do not create them if no input/output
  - [ ] when creating lane ports, re-arrange them so loops are first
  - [ ] loop tags
  - [ ] debug record loop info
  - [ ] fluid bus auto add loops
  - [ ] kovarex
  - [ ] coal liquefaction
- [ ] Helmod byproduct support: need to detect when a recipe is a byproduct - option to downgrade and upgrade items
- [ ] local fluid bus / local logistic network?
- [ ] Output options
  - [X] Up lane
  - [ ] Single chest
  - [ ] Buffer chests
  - [ ] Passive chests

Other:
- [-] Documentation
  - [X] add README
  - [-] mod page documentation
  - [-] advanced documentation
  - [X] mention related mods (mining, pumps)
  - [X] LICENSE and other libs
- [ ] final run through

======================================================================================
BUGFIXES - High Priority 
======================================================================================

======================================================================================
BUGFIXES - Medium Priority 
======================================================================================

- [ ] Helmod rocket doesn't work
- [ ] bugs with priority and light oil in space recipe : green only produce 4, not 5.6
- [ ] fluid buffer limits are too high if buffers are just used for transporting through
  - this may require more investigation, since high priority items should not be the final output of the bus
- [ ] output lane in templates should balance both sides, without the final balancer
- [ ] se cryonite recipe doesn't work

======================================================================================
Playtest TODOS
======================================================================================

- [ ] se test fuel refinery should work with standard refinery connector
- [ ] 4-1 fluid crafting
- [ ] space recipes?

======================================================================================
Future Releases 
======================================================================================

- [-] code cleanup
  - [ ] GUI code needs cleanup
  - [ ] improve main method in factorio directory
- [-] crash viewer
  - some support, but it generates large files - currently disabled
- [ ] Fluid temperature support
  - [ ] steam-165 issue
    - fluids need temperatures?
    - may be a FP issue
- [ ] custom recipe support - what metadata is needed?
 - [ ] support in Helmod
- [ ] CLI support
  - [ ] CLI arguments
    - [ ] profiling
    - [ ] which bus
  - [ ] CLI timing
- [ ] pumps for pipe lanes
  - will cause issues for directions
- [ ] template port throughput info / inserter throughput
- [ ] Optimization: merge underground belts
- [ ] pipe throughput: multiple pipes for a fluid
- [ ] Flow calculation based on template throughput
- [ ] yafc - needs code changes to record number of assemblers, and a way to know produce / consume recipes
- [ ] logistics templates
- [ ] logistics beacons
- [ ] upgrade planner
- [ ] logistic width
- [ ] Import multiple templates
- [ ] Export multiple templates
- [ ] Mall support
  - [ ] mall tags? for generating a chest at the output / deleting belts
  - [ ] circuitry to limit number (e.g. with buffer chests) or reserve slots?
- [ ] Ouput style up adds constant combinators at top
- [ ] Cache data initialization?  It currently takes around 300ms
- [ ] closing template editor should return to template page (keep template page open, similar to dialogs?)
- [ ] proper lane coloring base on port coords

======================================================================================
LOW PRIORITY 
======================================================================================

- [ ] Equivalence system fuel support
- [ ] space exploration: need to separate out machines or fluid networks can mix
- [ ] fluid logistic support
  - [ ] analyze inputs, find associated barrelling recipe, add barrelers and pipes (may have problems with some fluidboxes)
- [ ] save different config options, e.g. planet vs space?
- [ ] FactoryPlanner remote to process and return an export string
- [ ] move buffers closer to other factories if possible?
- [ ] get_region(s) from diagram, so we can avoid a compile
- [ ] FP string import needs to use GUI config
- [ ] combinator lane info can include flowrates plus time period
- [ ] bundle/strand system
  - [ ] clean up two lane bundle
  - [ ] multilane item bundle
- [ ] replace CoordTable.iterate with proper iterator

======================================================================================
MAYBE 
======================================================================================

- [ ] limit work per tick
  - [ ] need to work out slow bits and allow for stopping points
  - [ ] probably only for a few key methods
- [ ] connectors and other mods
  - [ ] connectors have mod list in their metadata
  - [ ] only show connectors for loaded mods
  - [ ] show all connectors option on GUI
- [ ] player access to Shift_connector (used if you set the centre incorrectly)
  - [ ] mod option to show / hide template editor

======================================================================================
NOTES 
======================================================================================

 - LuaItemStack import_stack and export_stack could be used instead of 
   base64/zlib/json
 - game.encode_string, decode_string, table_to_json, json_to_table
 - junctions for mod development:
  New-Item -ItemType "Junction" -Name "blueprinter-signals" -Value "<LOCATION>\mod\blueprinter-signals"
- reload control.lua:
  /c game.reload_mods()


======================================================================================
WON'T DO / FIX
======================================================================================

- [ ] find out why not all poles are connected via the electrical network
    - calculate the number of connected components?
- [ ] use FactoryPlanner modules to re-hydrate data, instead of using custom patch
  - data.calculation.interface.lua calculation.update
  - Factory.import_by_string(context.factory, export_string)
  - may be a bit tricky to use with CLI version
  - looking too difficult.  Will use a remote instead
- [ ] fluid box calculations
  - [X] instead let user set fluidbox index
- [ ] calculate fluid box inputs/outputs from machines?
- ? rotation support
- [ ] Custom combinator(s) for mod - replaced by tag system
- [ ] generic connectors for items: resize 
  - might be difficult with fluidboxes, which seem to appear everywhere
